The program is an app-like quiz which tests the user on various high school calculus questions.  It is created using elements from Javascript, CSS, and HTML.  It is also able to store 5 of the highest score the user has ever achieved and their names, as well as display images along with the pertinent question.

9/14/2022 - Updated the program to look much better and usable in mobile devices with CSS

<b>*10/15/2022</b> - Updated trivia program with 2 more calculus quizzes and also another quiz using the API from https://opentdb.com/.  Pulled the API data using fetch . The code for the random quiz had to be modified to adjust for the new array format.
